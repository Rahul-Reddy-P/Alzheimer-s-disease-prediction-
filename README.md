Alzheimer's disease (AD) is characterized by progressive neuronal loss leading to dementia. Magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) can be used to study structural changes in the brain associated with AD progression. Recently, deep learning approaches have shown promise for AD prediction from MRI. Convolutional neural networks (CNNs) are well-suited for learning discriminative features from MRI for classification. Deep learning has made significant advancements in the field of medical science and healthcare. Its applications range from medical image analysis to drug discovery, patient diagnosis, and treatment optimization. Deep learning methods like convolutional neural networks (CNNs) are increasingly used to predict Alzheimer's disease from structural MRI brain scans. CNNs are trained to extract discriminative features from MRI patches or voxels and classify disease status. Key considerations in model design include convolutional filters, pooling approaches, regularization, and transfer learning. Ongoing research focuses on improving interpretability to identify relevant brain regions. Deep learning shows promise for computer-aided diagnosis of Alzheimer's from MRI. Predicting Alzheimer's disease is a complex task, and there are several existing techniques and approaches to diagnose or predict the disease. These techniques vary in terms of accuracy, invasiveness, cost, and practicality. Some of these techniques involve methods like Biomarker analysis which requires cutting open the skull and also Neuro-Imaging which lacks the specificity. But, with the use of Deep Learning approaches like CNNâ€™s we can not only make the process easier, also gain state of the art accuracy in predicting the results. And the accuracy varies in between 85% to 90% compared to conventional methods which has an accuracy of 65%.
